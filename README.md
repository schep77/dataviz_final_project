The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In this project, I explored Airplane Crashes from 1908 till 2019. For this analysis, I looked into the fatality rate of the top five manufacturers, the regions that had the most crashs, and the sample visualization below, which shows the fatalities per year, and decade. 

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I continued to explore the Airplane Crash data from my previous project. In this analysis, I explored the crashes per operator per year, the crashes count by state, and the crash location. The final part of the project was to create a model, for that I looked into the summary of the crash. I created a Bi-gram to see what were the main reasons for these crashes.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 03

The goal of this project was to reproduce visualizations that show the distributions of continous variables based on a dataset containing weather information from Tampa's International Airport. In the below visualization, you can see the max temperatures per month displayed in a density ridge plot.

### Moving Forward

I really enjoyed doing these projects over the course of this semester. In the future, I wish to expand upon these projects to have better, and more telling visualizations. For example, in project 2 I wished to have a leaflet interactive plot where you could select which decade you saw crashes for.
