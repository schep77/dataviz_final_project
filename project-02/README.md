## Mini-Project 2

For this project, I am continuing with my Airplane Crash Data Since 1908 dataset. I am really excited to begin this project as I know I will be able to accomplish the analysis that I did not get to explore last time. That being said, I plan to explore the Operator data to see the operators with the most crashes, the Summary data to see what were the top crash explanations, and the Long and Lat data to see exactly where these crashes occurred.
