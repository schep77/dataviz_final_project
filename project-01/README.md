## Mini-Project 1

I choose to explore a dataset about airplane crashes. Aviation has always intrested me, and one of my favorite things is to go flying with my brother. Aviation has recently become pretty much my whole life as I now work for an aircraft company. Back in August, there was an accident that unfortunetly cost a co-worker his life. 

I am planning on exploring:
- Fatality Rate
- Location of Crashes
- number of crashes per year
